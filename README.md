##  What Problem Does ProRepo Solve?

Students build great projects — but:
- They remain scattered across GitHub, PDFs, and drives  
- There’s no **standard way to measure innovation**
- Recruiters struggle to filter *signal from noise*

**ProRepo fixes this** by acting as an **AI-first innovation layer** between students and industry.

---

##  Core Objectives

- Centralized, intelligent project showcasing  
- AI-based evaluation beyond grades and resumes  
- Domain-wise growth tracking and ranking  
- Direct connection to mentors, companies, and funding  
- Encourage multidisciplinary and project-based learning  

---

##  How It Works

### 1️⃣ Intelligent Project Ingestion
Students upload:
- Documentation  
- Images & demos  
- Videos or walkthroughs  

AI analyzes submissions to extract:
- Tech stack  
- Problem domain  
- Complexity & scalability  
- Innovation depth  

---

### 2️⃣ Domain Classification & Portfolio Building
Using NLP and clustering:
- Projects are auto-tagged (AI/ML, Sustainability, FinTech, etc.)
- Each student builds a **living innovation portfolio**
- Growth is tracked **over time**, not one-off

---

### 3️⃣ Adaptive Ranking Engine
Scores are calculated using:
- Innovation frequency  
- Cross-domain work  
- Peer & industry feedback  

✅ New domain = new ranking thread  
✅ No penalty for exploring multiple domains  

---

### 4️⃣ Industry & Opportunity Matching
Companies post:
- Internships  
- Challenges  
- Sponsored problems  

AI matches students based on:
- Project relevance  
- Skill depth  
- Domain history  

Students stay in control — opt in or out freely.

---

## ✅ Expected Impact

- Fair, transparent innovation evaluation  
- Stronger academia–industry bridge  
- Resume-less talent discovery  
- Continuous learning culture  
- Scalable student innovation ecosystem  

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning & AI** – scoring, matching, evaluation  
- **NLP** – domain tagging & content understanding  
- **Clustering & Classification**  
- **Backend & Databases** – portfolios, rankings, analytics  
- **Frontend** – React / Flutter based UI  

---

##  Future Roadmap

- Public shareable profiles (LinkedIn-style)  
- Gamification & badges  
- Peer collaboration & reviews  
- Blockchain-based originality verification  
- Grant & funding integration
